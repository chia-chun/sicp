Data-directed style:
  Using "intelligent operations"
  A new type is added -> modify every operation
  A new operation -> add only the new "intelligent operation"

  Most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be needed.

Message-passing style:
  Using "intelligent data objects"
  A new type is added -> add the new "intelligent data object"
  A new operation -> modify every type

  Most appropriate for a system in which new types must often be needed.
